Chapter 2: Literature Review

The field of task management systems has evolved significantly over the past decade, with numerous applications attempting to address the challenges of personal and organizational productivity. Traditional task management tools like Todoist, Trello, and Asana have established themselves as popular solutions, offering features such as task creation, deadline setting, and basic prioritization through manual user input. These systems typically employ simple priority levels (high, medium, low) that require users to make subjective judgments about task importance, often leading to inconsistent prioritization and inefficient time allocation.

Research in educational technology has highlighted the limitations of conventional task management approaches in academic settings. Studies by Johnson et al. (2020) in the Journal of Educational Technology found that manual task prioritization in educational environments often results in student overwhelm and poor time management, particularly when dealing with multiple assignments across different subjects. The authors noted that existing systems lack contextual awareness, failing to consider factors such as assignment complexity, prerequisite knowledge, and individual learning pace.

The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in productivity tools represents a promising advancement in task management. Recent studies have explored various approaches to automated task prioritization, including rule-based systems and machine learning models. For instance, research by Chen and Zhang (2021) demonstrated the effectiveness of natural language processing techniques in analyzing task descriptions to determine priority levels, achieving accuracy rates of up to 85% in their experiments with academic task datasets.

However, existing AI-powered task management solutions face several challenges. Commercial applications like Microsoft To Do with AI suggestions and Google Tasks with smart prioritization remain limited in their educational applications. These systems often lack domain-specific knowledge about academic workflows and fail to account for the unique dynamics of teacher-student interactions. Furthermore, many AI implementations suffer from "black box" problems, where users cannot understand or trust the reasoning behind automated suggestions.

Database design and architecture considerations have also been extensively studied in the context of educational management systems. Research by Gupta and Sharma (2019) in the International Journal of Computer Applications emphasized the importance of normalized database schemas for maintaining data integrity in multi-user educational platforms. Their work highlighted the need for robust relationship management between users, tasks, and assignments to support complex querying and reporting requirements.

Security and privacy concerns represent another critical area in the literature. With the increasing adoption of cloud-based task management systems, studies by Williams (2022) have examined the risks associated with storing sensitive educational data. The research underscores the necessity of implementing comprehensive security measures, including encryption, access controls, and audit trails, particularly in systems handling student performance data and personal information.

Despite these advancements, there remains a gap in the literature regarding comprehensive task management systems specifically designed for educational environments that combine intelligent prioritization with robust user management and secure file handling. The current work addresses this gap by developing a specialized application that leverages machine learning for task prioritization while maintaining the security and usability requirements of educational platforms.
