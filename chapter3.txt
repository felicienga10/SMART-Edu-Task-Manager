Chapter 3: System Design and Development

The SMART Edu Task Manager follows a modular, layered architecture designed to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns. Built using the Flask web framework with Python, the system implements a three-tier architecture consisting of presentation, application, and data layers. The presentation layer handles user interfaces through HTML templates and Bootstrap styling, while the application layer manages business logic across specialized modules for authentication, task management, and user roles. The data layer utilizes SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite for persistent storage, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.

The database design employs a normalized schema optimized for educational task management workflows. The core entities include User, Task, Assignment, Submission, and Notification tables, each designed to support the complex relationships between teachers and students. The User table accommodates multiple roles (teacher, student, admin) with role-specific fields, while the Task table captures detailed assignment information including deadlines, priorities, and file attachments. Relationships are established through foreign keys, enabling efficient querying of task assignments, student progress, and submission tracking.

The authentication system implements secure user management with Flask-Login for session handling and Werkzeug for password hashing. Role-based access control ensures that teachers can create and manage tasks, students can view assignments and submit work, and administrators have system-wide oversight capabilities. The system supports separate registration flows for teachers and students, collecting relevant profile information during account creation.

Task management functionality forms the core of the application, enabling teachers to create detailed assignments with automatic priority suggestions generated by the machine learning component. The priority prediction system employs a hybrid approach, combining rule-based keyword matching with a trained Naive Bayes classifier using TF-IDF vectorization. Teachers can accept, modify, or override these suggestions during task creation, ensuring expert judgment remains paramount while benefiting from AI assistance.

The assignment workflow supports direct student assignment during task creation, with status tracking through pending, in_progress, completed, and overdue states. Students receive personalized dashboards displaying their tasks sorted by priority and deadline, with visual indicators for urgent assignments. Progress updates occur in real-time as students mark tasks as started or completed, providing teachers with immediate visibility into class-wide productivity.

File handling capabilities enable both task instructions and student submissions to include attachments, with secure storage in a dedicated uploads directory. Files are renamed using UUIDs to prevent conflicts and enhance security, with type and size validation implemented to protect against malicious uploads. The system supports common educational file formats while maintaining reasonable size limits for both tasks and submissions.

A comprehensive notification system keeps users informed of important events, including new task assignments, upcoming deadlines, and submission feedback. Notifications are categorized by type (info, success, warning, error) and can be marked as read individually or in bulk. System administrators can broadcast announcements to all users or target specific user groups, enhancing communication within the educational environment.

The machine learning integration provides intelligent task prioritization through analysis of task descriptions. The current implementation uses keyword-based classification as a reliable fallback, with provisions for deploying trained ML models. The system analyzes text for urgency indicators, assignment types, and importance markers to suggest appropriate priority levels from a predefined taxonomy including urgent_important, high_priority, medium_priority, optional, and other specialized categories.

Security measures are implemented throughout the application, including CSRF protection on forms, input validation and sanitization, and secure file upload handling. The database design incorporates proper indexing and constraints to maintain data integrity, while the application follows OWASP security guidelines for web application development.

The user interface employs responsive design principles with Bootstrap 5, ensuring accessibility across devices. Teachers benefit from comprehensive dashboards for task creation, progress monitoring, and submission review, while students enjoy intuitive interfaces for task viewing, status updates, and work submission. The admin interface provides system management capabilities including user administration, analytics, and notification broadcasting.

Scalability considerations include the use of SQLAlchemy for database abstraction, enabling future migration to more robust databases like PostgreSQL. The modular code structure supports feature extensions, with clear separation between routes, forms, models, and business logic facilitating maintenance and enhancement.
