Chapter 1: Introduction

The increasing complexity of personal and professional tasks in today's fast-paced digital world has created a significant challenge for both educators and students in managing academic workloads effectively. Traditional task management methods often fail to account for varying priorities, deadlines, and the cognitive load associated with multiple assignments, leading to inefficient time allocation and potential academic stress. This thesis presents the design and development of a Smart Task Management Application that leverages machine learning algorithms to intelligently prioritize tasks, providing users with actionable insights for better workflow organization.

The primary problem addressed by this work is the lack of intelligent tools that can automatically assess task importance based on contextual factors such as deadlines, task descriptions, and user behavior patterns. Current task management systems typically require manual prioritization, which can be subjective and time-consuming, especially for educators managing assignments for multiple students. The application aims to solve this by implementing a hybrid approach combining rule-based keyword matching with machine learning models to suggest optimal task priorities during creation.

The main objectives of this research include developing a web-based platform that facilitates seamless interaction between teachers and students, implementing machine learning algorithms for automatic task prioritization, and evaluating the system's effectiveness in improving productivity and user satisfaction. The application will feature user authentication, task creation and assignment capabilities, progress tracking, file submission handling, and a notification system to keep all stakeholders informed. By integrating machine learning techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes classification, the system will provide intelligent suggestions that can be overridden by teachers based on their expertise.

The benefits of this work extend beyond the immediate educational context, offering practical solutions for any organization seeking to optimize task management processes. The research will contribute to the growing field of AI-assisted productivity tools, demonstrating how machine learning can enhance traditional workflow management systems. Furthermore, the modular architecture of the application ensures scalability and adaptability for future enhancements such as advanced analytics, mobile integration, and collaborative features.
